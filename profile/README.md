# Infrastructure for the busy professional
Stackmate takes care of your infrastructure, without learning new programming languages, creating long scripts or following some manual, error-prone, poorly documented internal process.
Using a super simple configuration file, stackmate deploys infrastructure on **your** cloud provider without any hidden costs or surprises. You get full ownership and control over your infrastructure, stackmate only handles the configuration
